       "23   When I think of a definition of research, I have this philosophical idea in mind: “searching for the information you want and finding what you need instead.” I used to research with the goal of finding information that supports my claim, however, I would often find information disproving my claim or altering it in some way. When this happens, I am forced to change my claims because the information provided to me is what I need for my subject, even if it was not necessarily what I wanted.    \n",
