*Data analysis projects (in progress and completed)*
- UC Berkeley UE Data Team 
  -   Data 8 and Data 100 Webscrape
      - Description: A team of researchers with a National Science Foundation grant have been studying the diversity of data science students at UC Berkeley. As part of this grant, we (UE Data Team) administer surveys to students who are involved in data science. Each term we create a seed file for the survey. One part of the seed file is undergraduate students who are teaching for Data 8 and Data 100. We obtain the names and email addresses of these undergraduates from the Data 8 and Data 100 websites.
      - Tools: Python, BeautifulSoup library 
  -   Pulse Survey Data Source & Tableau Dashboard Generation (IN PROGRESS) 
      - Description: The student pulse survey website is being converted to Tableau dashboards. These dashboards will be filterable. An example of the Tableau dashboard are the UCUES results on the website for the Office of Planning and Analysis.
      - Tools: Python, Tableau, scikit-learn library 
      - NOTE: This project was completed with mmy coworkers (Meer Wu, Alex Nguyen, Ashley Alvarez, and Maricruz Montes de Oca-Sanchez). The multiselect_transformers file was initally created by me and edited by my peers. The singleselect_transformers and cleaning_transformers file were initially created by my coworkers and edited by me. They are included so that the data_source_generation file can be easily comprehended. The data source generated from this file is put into a Tableau workbook to create the completed published dashboards on https://opa.berkeley.edu/campus-surveys/survey-results-reporting-analysis/uc-undergraduate-experience-survey-ucues!
